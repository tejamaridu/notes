### What are the Java 8 features?
Java 8 provides the following features for Java Programming:
1.	Lambda expressions
2.	Method references
3.	Functional interfaces
4.	Stream API
5.	Default methods
6.	Base64 Encode Decode
7.	Static methods in the interface
8.	Optional class
9.	Collectors class
10.	ForEach() method
11.	Nashorn JavaScript Engine
12.	Parallel Array Sorting
13.	Type and Repeating Annotations
14.	IO Enhancements
15.	Concurrency Enhancements
16.	JDBC Enhancements, etc.

### 1. Lambda Expressions:
**Definition:** Lambda expression is a concise way to define an anonymous function, or implementation for a functional interface method and just like a method it accepts parameters and returns value.
•	It allows us to treat code as data, pass functionality as a method argument or define small, one-time-use functions.
•	It also helps to iterate, filter and extract data from collection libraries.
